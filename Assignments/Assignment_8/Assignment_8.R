#1 loads the “/Data/mushroom_growth.csv” data set
#2 creates several plots exploring relationships between the response and predictors
#3 defines at least 4 models that explain the dependent variable “GrowthRate”
#4 calculates the mean sq. error of each model
#5 selects the best model you tried
#6 adds predictions based on new hypothetical values for the independent variables used in your model
#7 plots these predictions alongside the real data
